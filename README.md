# Lc3b-pipelined-simulator
This is a cycle by cycle simulator of the LC-3b theoretical architecture, with modifications made to support pipelining. This project was made to complete Lab 6 of UT Austin's Computer Architecture course. 

The architecture of this pipelined processor was largely designed by hand, and microcode is included to facilitate rtl flow in the simulator.
